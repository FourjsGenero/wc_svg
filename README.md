# !!! DEPRECATED !!!

The 3.10 release of Genero includes Built-in Web Components, one of which is the fglsvgcanvas Web Component http://4js.com/online_documentation/fjs-fgl-manual-html/#c_fgl_fgl_web_components_fglsvgcanvas.html. I would encourage you to use this for the construction and display of SVG images.

I will at some stage look to refactor some of the libraries I had started here to work with the fglsvgcanvas Web Component but will do that in seperate fgl repositories.

There is a lot of potential of things you can do with the fglsvgcanvas Web Component.
